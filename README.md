This is the repository for my Laracon Online talk about Laravel's service container.
It includes all the examples that I showed during my presentation.

* `start` is the branch that I started my talk off
* the `examples` branch is where I showed the examples for `Facades` and my `Custom MailManager`
* `Slides` of my talke can be found on my [website](https://christoph-rumpel.com/speaking).
